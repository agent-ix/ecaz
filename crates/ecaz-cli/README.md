# ecaz-cli

Operator CLI for the Ecaz Postgres vector extension. Single binary, single
entry point, profile-aware across access methods.

## Status

The CLI is now the supported operator surface for:

- corpus preparation, generation, loading, inspection, and listing
- recall / latency / storage / overhead benches
- pgvector comparison
- vacuum stress validation
- scratch-cluster control and local development/test helpers

Wrapper scripts that only forwarded into one of those surfaces are being
removed from `main`. The remaining live shell entry points are either
`make` aliases or truly generic repo helpers that do not have a better
home in the operator CLI.

## Why another CLI

The `scripts/` directory grew organically as each benchmark was added: each
one duplicated argument parsing, psql plumbing, reloption quoting, and its
own notion of "what is an HNSW index." `ecaz-cli` replaces that with:

- One entry point (`ecaz`), one `--help` tree.
- A declarative `IndexProfile` registry — commands don't hardcode
  `tqvector` / `ecvector` / `ec_hnsw` / `ec_ivf` / `ec_diskann`. Adding a new access
  method is one entry in `profiles.rs` plus whatever AM-specific logic
  the new method needs.
- Async Postgres (`tokio-postgres`) instead of shelling out to `psql`.
- Rich terminal output (`indicatif`, `comfy-table`) with consistent
  progress and results formatting.

## Install

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo install --path crates/ecaz-cli
```

That puts `ecaz` on `$PATH`. All commands accept `--database`, `--host`,
`--port`, `--user`, `--password`, and `--log-file`; each also falls back to
the matching libpq environment variable (`PGDATABASE`, `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`,
`PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`) when the flag is omitted. `--host` may be either a
TCP host name or a Unix socket directory such as `/home/peter/.pgrx`.
`--log-file` mirrors the CLI's stdout/stderr into a packet-local artifact
file so review runs do not need shell `tee` wrappers. When `--log-file` is
set, transient progress bars are suppressed so the artifact stays stable.

Development SQL can be run through the CLI without shell redirection:

```sh
ecaz dev sql --pg 18 --file review/example/artifacts/run.sql --raw \
  --log-output review/example/artifacts/run.log
```

Use repeated `--env NAME=VALUE` flags to pass temporary environment to
the underlying `psql` process.

Each command accepts `--profile` (e.g. `ec_hnsw`, `ec_ivf`, `ec_diskann`) so a
single corpus can be measured against multiple access methods without
re-loading data. Today `ec_hnsw`, `ec_ivf`, and `ec_diskann` all use `ecvector` as
the embedding column type, so one `<prefix>_corpus` table supports multiple
indexes side-by-side.

For the real-corpus path, the intended flow is now:

```sh
ecaz corpus fetch --output-dir /path/to/qdrant-dbpedia-openai3-1m
ecaz corpus prepare \
  --profile ec_hnsw_real_10k \
  --parquet /path/to/qdrant-dbpedia-openai3-1m/data \
  --output-dir /path/to/staged
ecaz corpus load \
  --log-file review/11073-task17-diskann-real-10k-recall/artifacts/load.log \
  --prefix ec_hnsw_real_10k \
  --corpus-file /path/to/staged/ec_hnsw_real_10k_corpus.tsv \
  --queries-file /path/to/staged/ec_hnsw_real_10k_queries.tsv \
  --profile ec_diskann
```

`ecaz corpus fetch` currently pins one first-class remote dataset:
Qdrant's DBpedia OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` `1536`-dimensional
1M-row release on Hugging Face. It writes deterministic parquet shard
names under `<output-dir>/data/` plus a small `ecaz_fetch_manifest.json`
recording the source repo and revision.

## Access-method profiles

Profiles live in `src/profiles.rs` and describe:

- `access_method` — the `USING <am>` clause value.
- `operator_class` — the opclass used in `CREATE INDEX`.
- `embedding_type` — the column type used for the indexed expression.
- `encoder_function` — the SQL function that encodes `real[]` into that type.
- `ef_search_guc` — the per-scan tuning GUC name.
- `build_source_column` — whether the AM can index from a raw `real[]`
  column (HNSW can; DiskANN reads the indexed column directly).
- `sweep_axis` — which parameter the CLI should sweep by default
  (`m` for HNSW, `list_size` for DiskANN, `None` for AMs without a
  natural single axis).
- `known_reloptions` — reloption keys the CLI knows about. Unknown keys
  are still accepted via `--reloption key=value` passthrough; this set
  is for help text and light validation only.

### Drift risk, and the plan

The CLI currently hand-mirrors the extension's opclass and reloption
surface (`src/am/ec_hnsw/options.rs`, `src/am/ec_ivf/options.rs`,
`src/am/ec_diskann/options.rs`).
That's fine for two access methods and a small handful of knobs, but
won't stay fine as the surface grows.

The planned fix — deferred to a follow-up PR — is to extract a
`crates/ecaz-core` crate exporting the shared constants and bounds, and
have both the extension (pgrx) and this CLI depend on it. Then the CLI
cannot drift from the extension: adding `use_pq_rerank: bool` to DiskANN
will either compile everywhere or break the build.

For v1 we accept the small duplication. If drift bites before then,
promote the extraction PR.

## Multiple corpora

A "corpus" is a named fixture identified by `--prefix`. Each corpus
occupies:

- `<prefix>_corpus`  — the row table (id, source real[], embedding).
- `<prefix>_queries` — the query-set table (id, source real[]).
- Any number of indexes on `<prefix>_corpus.embedding`.

Many corpora coexist in one database. Benchmarks target them by prefix:

```sh
ecaz corpus load --prefix dbpedia_10k   --corpus-file dbpedia_10k_corpus.tsv   ...
ecaz corpus load --prefix cohere_100k   --corpus-file cohere_100k_corpus.tsv   ...
ecaz corpus load --prefix dbpedia_10k --profile ec_diskann   ...  # adds a second index on the same corpus
```

`ecaz corpus list` shows what's loaded; `ecaz corpus inspect <prefix>`
shows the indexes built on it.

## Performance notes

- Brute-force ground truth for `bench recall` uses `ndarray` + `rayon`.
  At 1M rows × 1536 dim this lands around 1–3 seconds per 100-query
  batch — roughly 95% of what FAISS (C++) would give us, with zero
  non-Rust build deps.
- TSV ingest (`corpus load`) streams with `tokio::io::BufReader` +
  `COPY FROM STDIN`. Handles 10M-row corpora in seconds, not minutes.

If either ever becomes the bottleneck, the escape hatch is a FAISS-FFI
dep (via the `faiss` crate) for ground truth, or `simd-json` for ingest.
Neither is needed today.

## Testing

```sh
cargo test -p ecaz-cli
cargo pgrx test pg18
ecaz dev test pgrx
ecaz dev test pgrx --pg 18
ecaz dev test pg18-preload-pgstat
```

Unit tests cover `profiles`, `reloptions`, and the SQL builders in
`psql`, and the dev/test helpers now own the old wrapper-script validation
surface directly.
