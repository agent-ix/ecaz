# Master Requirements Specification
## tqvector — PostgreSQL Extension for TurboQuant Vector Search

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **scope, intent, and governing requirements framework** for `tqvector`, a PostgreSQL extension written in Rust (pgrx) that registers a native `tqvector` data type and HNSW index access method over TurboQuant-compressed vectors.

It establishes:
- The problem space: native approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in PostgreSQL using TurboQuant quantization for 8–10x storage compression with provably unbiased inner product estimation
- The boundaries of responsibility: type system, distance computation, index access method, SQL bootstrap — nothing above the Postgres extension boundary
- The authoritative structure for requirements, verification, and change control
- The relationship between the TurboQuant algorithm (paper + `turbo-quant` crate), the HNSW graph structure (`hnsw_rs` crate + pgvector page layout), and the Postgres extension interface (pgrx)

This document is the **top-level requirements artifact** for the `tqvector` repository.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope

This specification governs:
- The `tqvector` PostgreSQL data type: wire format, text I/O, binary I/O, storage
- Encoding: compression of fp32 vectors into TurboQuant bytecodes via the `turbo-quant` crate
- Distance functions: asymmetric inner product estimation between `tqvector` values
- SQL operators: `<#>` (negative inner product for ORDER BY ASC)
- Operator classes for HNSW index integration
- HNSW index access method (AM): all IndexAmRoutine callbacks — build, insert, scan, vacuum
- Page layout: metadata page, element tuples, neighbor tuples (modeled on pgvector)
- WAL safety: GenericXLog usage for crash-safe page writes
- SQL bootstrap: CREATE TYPE, CREATE OPERATOR, CREATE OPERATOR CLASS, CREATE ACCESS METHOD
- Extension lifecycle: CREATE EXTENSION / DROP EXTENSION / ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE

### 2.2 Out of Scope

This specification does not govern:
- The TurboQuant quantization algorithm itself (owned by `turbo-quant` crate and the research paper)
- The HNSW graph construction algorithm itself (owned by `hnsw_rs` crate)
- Application-level schema design (e.g., `agent_memories` table — owned by the agent memory system)
- Query routing, write buffering, merge daemons, or prefetch daemons (owned by upstream system components)
- PyO3 Python bindings (`turboquant_py` — separate component)
- Cosine similarity or L2 distance metrics (inner product only in v0.1)

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 System Description

`tqvector` is a PostgreSQL extension that brings TurboQuant-compressed vector storage and HNSW approximate nearest neighbor search directly into the database engine. It is the central component of the agent vector memory system architecture.

**Why build this instead of using existing extensions:**
- **pgvecto.rs**: deprecated, superseded by VectorChord
- **VectorChord**: AGPLv3 / ELv2 licensing — problematic for product use
- **pgvector HNSW**: MIT licensed (reference for page layout), but stores fp32 vectors — no TurboQuant compression, 8–10x larger storage

`tqvector` combines:
1. The `turbo-quant` crate for data-oblivious quantization (no training, no fitting)
2. The `hnsw_rs` crate for graph construction and traversal logic
3. pgvector's page layout as the direct reference for Postgres storage integration
4. pgrx for safe Rust ↔ Postgres FFI

**Compression characteristics** (1536-dim, 4-bit):
- Raw fp32: 6,144 bytes per vector
- TurboQuant code: ~768 bytes per vector (8x compression)
- ~30 element tuples per 8KB Postgres page vs ~1 for pgvector
- Significantly reduced I/O during graph traversal

### 3.2 Phased Migration Strategy

The extension is NOT a blocking prerequisite for the agent memory system. The system is designed for incremental cutover:

**Phase 1 — No extension required (working today):**
- `embedding vector(1536)` column — pgvector fp32 HNSW finds ~100 candidates
- `tq_code bytea` column — TurboQuant compressed codes stored alongside
- Python-side `rerank_batch()` re-scores candidates using TurboQuant codes
- Net: ~5% recall improvement over raw HNSW for negligible latency
- **Interim optimization**: replace `vector(1536)` with `halfvec(1536)` (pgvector fp16 type) to cut HNSW index from 88MB → 44MB per agent with zero code changes

**Phase 2 — After extension is ready:**
- `tqvector` column replaces both `embedding` and `tq_code`
- HNSW runs natively over compressed codes inside the index AM
- Storage drops from 6GB → ~200MB per million vectors
- fp32/fp16 column deleted entirely

The query router is useful on day one in phase 1. Building the extension does not block any other component.

### 3.3 Query Strategy: HNSW vs Sequential Scan

Not all queries require HNSW. TurboQuant sequential scan over compressed codes is fast enough for small agents:

| Agent Size | Strategy | Latency | Recall |
|---|---|---|---|
| < 500K memories | Sequential scan over tqvector codes | ~3ms | 100% (exact) |
| >= 500K memories | HNSW index scan | < 5ms p99 | ~94–99% (depends on m) |

Sequential scan has **better recall** than HNSW because it scores every row — no graph traversal approximation. The query router chooses strategy based on `memory_count` from `agent_registry`. The extension must support both paths: sequential scan uses `tqvector_inner_product` as a plain function, HNSW uses it as the index distance function.

### 3.4 HNSW m Parameter Decision Rules

| m | Index Size/Agent | Recall@10 | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | ~88MB | ~99% | Only if recall is critical |
| 8 | ~34MB | ~97% | **Default choice** |
| 4 | ~17MB | ~94% | Stub indexes only (always-warm, 20% sample) |

### 3.5 Known API Risk: Code-to-Code Inner Product

The HNSW index AM distance function (`tqvector_inner_product`) must compare two encoded vectors during graph traversal — every edge evaluation calls this function.

**If `turbo-quant` exposes `inner_product_estimate(&[u8], &[u8])`** (both sides encoded): use it directly. Optimal performance.

**If not**: must call `decode_approximate` on one side first, then score. This adds allocation + computation to every graph edge traversal — potentially significant.

**Mitigation**: before building 3c (HNSW AM), validate the `turbo-quant` crate API. If code-to-code scoring is missing, either contribute it upstream or fork the crate. Do not proceed to page layout code with a known slow-path in the distance function.

### 3.6 Scaling Boundary: Cross-Agent Fan-Out

For cross-agent queries, the query router fans out to all shards. This works for the current partition count (16 shards) but flat fan-out degrades beyond ~200-500 shards. The extension itself does not own routing, but the query router must be designed for eventual hierarchical routing (regional aggregators). The extension SHALL NOT assume or enforce any fan-out strategy.

### 3.7 Intended Users

- **Agent memory system**: primary consumer — stores and queries per-agent embedding memories
- **Platform engineers**: install, configure, and monitor the extension in PostgreSQL clusters
- **Application developers**: use `tqvector` type and `<#>` operator in SQL queries for ANN search

### 3.8 Design Constraints

- **MIT License**: the extension must be MIT licensed (we own it)
- **No algorithm reimplementation**: use `turbo-quant` and `hnsw_rs` crates as dependencies; do not reimplement their internals
- **pgvector page layout compatibility**: follow pgvector's page layout patterns exactly for element tuples and neighbor tuples (with `tqvector` code bytes replacing fp32 vector bytes)
- **pgrx framework**: must compile under the pgrx build system and support pg14–pg17

## 6. Requirement Identification

| Artifact | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Stakeholder Requirement | `StR-XXX` | `StR-001` |
| User Story | `US-XXX` | `US-001` |
| Functional Requirement | `FR-XXX` | `FR-001` |

---

## 7. Requirement Quality Policy

All **functional requirements** SHALL:
- Define observable behavior
- Be unambiguous and atomic
- Avoid implementation details unless required for correctness
- Be testable through explicit criteria

Functional requirements SHALL NOT:
- Encode application-specific schema (that belongs to the consuming system)
- Contain compound behaviors
- Use subjective language

---

## 8. Data Model

### 8.1 tqvector Wire Format

The `tqvector` type is a variable-length Postgres datum (`typlen = -1`) with the following binary layout (little-endian):

```
Offset  Size    Field       Description
0       2       dim         Vector dimensionality (u16)
2       1       bits        Quantization bits (u8, range 2–8)
3       8       seed        Quantizer seed (u64)
11      var     codes       TurboQuant bytecodes
```

Code length: `ceil(dim * (bits-1) / 8) + ceil(dim / 8)` bytes.

### 8.2 HNSW Page Layout

Modeled on pgvector (reference: `src/hnswinsert.c`, `src/hnswscan.c`).

**Page 0 — Metadata:**
- M (max neighbors per layer)
- ef_construction
- entry_point block number and offset
- dimensions

**Page 1+ — Interleaved tuples:**

| Tuple Type | Tag | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| TqElementTuple | `0x01` | deleted flag, heap TIDs (up to 10), neighbor TID pointer, tqvector code bytes |
| TqNeighborTuple | `0x02` | count, per-layer neighbor TID arrays (M at layers > 0, 2M at layer 0) |

### 8.3 Quantizer Parameters

The quantizer is **data-oblivious** — fully determined by `(dim, bits, seed)`. No training data, no calibration, no warm-up. A new table's first INSERT produces valid compressed codes immediately.

---

## 9. Events and Signals

### 9.1 Event Model

This extension does not emit domain events. It participates in PostgreSQL's standard signaling:
- WAL records via GenericXLog for crash recovery
- VACUUM signaling for dead tuple cleanup
- Index scan lifecycle callbacks

### 9.2 WAL Guarantees

All page writes SHALL use `GenericXLogStart` / `GenericXLogRegisterBuffer` / `GenericXLogFinish` to ensure crash-safe durability. No page modification may occur outside a GenericXLog transaction.

---

## 10. Error and Failure Model

### 10.1 Error Classification

| Category | Examples | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Input validation | Dimension mismatch, invalid bits range, corrupt hex in text I/O | `ereport(ERROR)` with descriptive message |
| Type mismatch | Comparing tqvectors with different dim/bits | `ereport(ERROR)` |
| Storage corruption | Invalid page layout, truncated code bytes | `ereport(ERROR)` — do not crash the backend |
| Resource exhaustion | Out of shared_buffers during index build | Standard Postgres OOM handling |

### 10.2 Failure Handling Guarantees

- The extension SHALL NOT cause a Postgres backend crash under any input
- Invalid inputs SHALL produce clear `ERROR`-level messages with context
- Partial index builds SHALL be safely abortable (GenericXLog guarantees atomicity)

---

## 11. Traceability

Bidirectional traceability SHALL be maintained between:
- Stakeholder Requirements → User Stories / Functional Requirements
- User Requirements → Functional Requirements
- Functional Requirements → Acceptance Criteria
- Acceptance Criteria → Test Cases

---

## 12. Verification Strategy

| Verification Method | Scope |
|---|---|
| `cargo test` (unit) | Wire format pack/unpack, text parse/format, code length calculation |
| `cargo pgrx test` (pg_test) | Type I/O round-trips, operator behavior, encode helper |
| Integration tests | HNSW index build, scan, vacuum on realistic data |
| Recall benchmarks | Recall@10 at 50k×1536 against known ground truth |

---

## 13. Change Management

All requirements artifacts are configuration-controlled. Changes require impact analysis. Approved changes update affected requirements, tests, and traceability.

---

## 14. Lifecycle Status

Requirements declare status: DRAFT → APPROVED → IMPLEMENTED → VERIFIED → DEPRECATED.

---

## 15. Governance Notes

- Functional requirements SHALL precede code changes
- The `turbo-quant` and `hnsw_rs` crate APIs are external dependencies — changes to their public API require a CR
- pgvector source is a reference, not a dependency — we translate page layout patterns, not link against it
