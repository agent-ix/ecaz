# Task 185 fixed-cap screen manifest

- Task bucket / packet: `reviews/task-185/003-fixed-cap-screen/`
- Status: preregistration only; no benchmark artifacts captured
- Preregistration head: `a1f1e3fb1`
- Planned first scale: 100k (`ec_real_100k`)
- Planned topology: three-owner physical sharded generation, one index per
  arm, run directories under `/home/peter/.ecaz/clusters/`
- Planned controls: cap 4096, exact head scoring, 32 seeds, graph degree 32,
  BW4/H100, RaBitQ traversal, exact final ranking
- Planned split: training rows 201--400; held-out evaluation rows 1--200
- Required runner: `ecaz bench suite` with a packet-local SuiteConfig

The implementation and candidate-level attribution contract must be reviewed
and committed before any run is added here. Corpus TSVs, truth caches, cluster
directories, and operational logs are not packet evidence and must not be
committed.
